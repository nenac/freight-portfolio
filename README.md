# Freight Workflow Automation

End-to-end freight logistics system designed and implemented for a B2B manufacturer shipping heavy equipment to pharmaceutical, beverage, and food processing customers nationwide.

## The Problem

Freight coordination was entirely manual. Customer shipping details lived in scattered email threads, quotes had no comparison framework, and there was no centralized tracking from request through delivery. The team relied on memory and sticky notes for shipment status.

## The Solution

A structured 13-step workflow connecting five existing tools into a single system with clear handoffs, automated data flow, and templated communications at every customer touchpoint.

**Tools:** Google Sheets (4-tab workbook), Front (shared email with templates), Odoo CRM, Zulip, warehouse coordination

**Five phases:** Customer Intake, Quote Generation, Payment Processing, Fulfillment, Close and Track

## What This Demonstrates

- Zero-to-one process design in a high-ambiguity environment
- Cross-functional coordination across sales, operations, and warehouse teams
- CRM and data flow architecture built on existing tools with zero licensing costs
- SOP documentation that enables any team member to run the workflow independently
